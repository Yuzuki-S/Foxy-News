Product Owner: Maintain the readme as the agreed requirements of the project.  If these requirements change, make the change in the readme and then notify affected teams.
Architecture Team: Maintain the documentation of the readme with respect to the APIs.  Routes, payloads and behaviours.  This is the agreement on how data will flow in the app.
Backend Team: Build the APIs as per the readme and test them with Postman
Frontend Team: Build the wireframes in conjunction with the product owner and then build the interface
Timekeeper: Schedules and calls standups (can be done by the product owner)

Notes:
- Push to your branch, pull request to Dev.
- Pull requests for all features and have them reviewed by Engie, Kelly or Ross.
